CSS Flex practice

###By Gracie Lundell

##Description
A work-in-progress recreation of AirBnB's website. This recreation utilizes media queries for viewability across platforms, as well as flexbox to arrange items on the page.

##Setup
To view this webpage and the code behind it, clone this repository. Then open it using the text editor of your choice. Once opened, drag the <code>index.html</code> tab into the header of your web browser to view the project in its current state.
To add styling, through your terminal on a Mac, install <code>$ gem install sass</code>. When this is completed, run <code>$ sass -v</code> to ensure installation and check what version of the program you now have. Now, run <code>$ sass --watch scss:css</code> to have Sass watch your project for changes it needs to compile from the scss file into the css file (which is what the webpage actually reads).
